This notebook helps to simplify the training of yolov3 you can run all the cells and enter the objects on which you would like to train your data the notebook downloads the data from goolge storage api and starts the training

* Please create a yolov3 folder in your google drive and please make sure that there is no other folder of that name
* If you want to train again please rename the earlier folder and make another yolov3 folder in your drive (Make sure that folder is empty) If you already have the annotations and images then please upload them to yolov3 in obj.zip format and make sure that on unzipping it generates only obj folder and in that the inmage and annotations make sure that annotations are in yolo format and if you have some other annotations please check the script in the notebook that converts the annotationsPlease make sure that the naming conventions are followed as specified in the notebook otherwise this will not work
* obj.data, obj.names take time to reflect so if it does not work please refresh the contents and run the code again 
* Well That's it enjoy
